[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/winter-is-coming.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

This website was built for the [Web Design] class I took at UCD. The brief for the website was:
> Design a website to promote a particular holiday resort

I chose to build a website for a fictional ski resort called Mountain Ridge in Colorado.
